Shopping List Prompt: 
 
    Task: Convert the Meal Plan into a consolidated North American shopping list (JSON).
    
    CRITICAL RULES:
    1. **MERGE AGGRESSIVELY**: Combine interchangeable ingredients into broad categories.
       - (e.g., "Beef strips" + "Flank steak" -> "Beef (Stir-fry cut)")
       - (e.g., "Scallions" + "Green onions" -> "Green Onions")
    
    2. **UNITS (North America)**:
       - **Meat/Bulk**: MUST use 'lbs' or 'oz'. (No grams).
       - **Produce**: MUST use 'count' or 'bunch'. (No 'stalks', 'slices').
