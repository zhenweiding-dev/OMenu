## What is OMenu?

OMenu turns a few taps into a complete **Plan → Shop → Cook** loop, powered by Gemini 3. Users express preferences in natural language, pick a weekly schedule, and OMenu generates three deeply linked outputs:

- **Menu Book** — a full week of meals, browsable by day
- **Cooking Handbook** — tap any dish for exact ingredients with quantities matched to your household, step-by-step instructions, cook time, difficulty, and calories
- **Shopping List** — ingredients consolidated across every recipe, categorized, unit-converted, and ready to check off at the store

Change one dish, and the shopping list updates. Add a dish manually, and AI never overwrites it. The three outputs form a closed loop — not a chat response, but a structured, interactive, persistent application with AI as the engine.

## How It Works — The 2.5-Step AI Pipeline

OMenu doesn't send a single prompt to Gemini 3. It runs a **2.5-step orchestrated pipeline** where each step solves a distinct hard problem, and each output precisely constrains the next:

```
Creativity → Structure → Precision
```

**Step 1 — Creative Outline + Draft Shopping List**

Deliberately unstructured — just dish names and ingredient names, no recipes or quantities. This frees Gemini 3 to focus its full reasoning on the multi-constraint optimization: taste, dislikes, budget, people, schedule, nutrition, variety, and ingredient reuse — all at once, within a capped ingredient count (~12–36 items).

**Step 2 — Structured Menu + Cooking Handbook**

Step 1's output locks down the ingredient space. With the "what" decided, Gemini 3 concentrates on the "how" — exact quantities, step-by-step instructions, calorie estimates, cook times. Structured JSON output simultaneously produces the daily cookbook and lays the data foundation for Step 3.

**Step 2.5 — Shopping List Consolidation**

Merging near-duplicates across up to 21 meals, converting heterogeneous units to North American standards, calculating aggregated quantities, and categorizing for grocery-store navigation. Complex enough to need the model's full attention as a dedicated step.

Each step is validated and normalized by a Python layer (category correction, quantity coercion, seasoning zero-out) before reaching the frontend.
